<h1>NECAAP</h1>
<h1>North East Cambridge Area Action Plan</h1>
<p><i></i></p>

Cambridge City Council is delighted to announce building new homes on
the "Brown Field" land occupied by the sewerage works. Of course they
are pleased with themselves, spending over a quarter of a billion
pounds they can move the sewer out of their council into South
Cambridgeshire or East Cambridgeshire.

I venture that the project an proposals rely on deception, half-truths
its a con.

<h3>Brown Field site?</h3>
<p>No. the project relies on consuming an equal amount of land from
    the greenbelt</p>
<h3>Project Benefits more than 1/2 million people?</h3>
No. Anglian Water have no operational requirement for the change, in
fact there is still spare capacity at the current site in North Cambridge.
