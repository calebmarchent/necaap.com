<h1>NECAAP</h1>
<h1>North East Cambridge Area Action Plan</h1>
<p><i></i></p>

Cambridge City Council is delighted to announce building new homes on
the "Brown Field" land occupied by the sewerage works. Of course they
are pleased with themselves, spending over a quarter of a billion
pounds they can move the sewer out of their council into South
Cambridgeshire or East Cambridgeshire.

I venture that the project an proposals rely on deception, half-truths
its a con.

<h3>Brown Field site?</h3>
<p>No. the project relies on consuming an equal amount of land from
    the greenbelt</p>
<h3>Project Benefits more than &frac12; million people?</h3>
No. Anglian Water have no operational requirement for the change, in
fact there is still spare capacity at the current site in North Cambridge.

<h2>Split consultations / divide and conquer</h2>
<p>The sewerage relocation project has been split from North East Cambridge
    Area Action consultation allowing city councilors to evangelise about the
wonderful benefits of tiny, expensive overcrowded homes keeping the impacts on
the recipient villages of Histon, Impington, Milton, Landbeach, Horningsea
    off the agenda.

    <h3>Green Belt?</h3>
<p>The nature and structure of homes, and communities is so very important to
well-being of each of us. Cambridge has until recently been a small city nestled
amongst quaint, beautiful farming villages. Each of which has welcome regular
    growth with the arrival of new families during the decades since the war.
<br>
    The North East Cambridge proposal, breaks the skin of the greenbelt stabbing
    into it and bringing about a new dawn with Cambridge on route to become another
    heartless sprawling mass of concrete and tarmac.
</p>

    <h3>Prevailing Winds</h3>
<p>Odour mapping shows that despite the promise of new "cleaner" technology;
odour from the relocated site will still reach up to 1km. As UK winds are West
    to South West this is directly in-line to villages of Milton and Landbeach.
    In fact this is much worse than it is today; where the land to the east of
    the current site is most unoccupied.
</p>
<h3>How much will it cost?</h3>
Total cost of the relocation of Cambridge Water Treatment site is budgeted at
&pound;274 million; that equates to &pound;34,250 for each of the 8000 households. Though
as I understand it none of this cost is being paid by the future home owners
payment comes from national infrastructure funds.
